## üéØ Purpose

The **Martial Arts Gym Finder** was created to address a common challenge faced by martial arts enthusiasts in Ontario, Canada: finding gyms or dojos that specialize in their specific discipline and are conveniently located. Many martial arts organizations and gyms lack centralized directories, making it difficult to identify suitable training options.

Another issue arises when individuals, especially those aiming to compete, search online for a specific martial art, such as Judo or Boxing. Instead of finding dedicated dojos or gyms, they often encounter facilities primarily focused on other martial arts but offering occasional classes in the desired discipline. Recognizing that competitions like Judo or Boxing in Ontario typically require participation under specific organizations, this project was designed to consolidate information into a centralized database. The result is a platform that helps practitioners find gyms or dojos dedicated to their chosen martial art.

This project aims to:  
- **Simplify Search**: Offer an intuitive platform for users to search for gyms by martial art discipline and location.  
- **Promote Accessibility**: Bridge the gap between martial arts organizations and potential members by centralizing and organizing essential information.
